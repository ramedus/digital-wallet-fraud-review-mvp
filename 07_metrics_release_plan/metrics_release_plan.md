## Metrics

To measure the success of the Suspicious Transaction & Fraud Review MVP, we will track the following key metrics:

1. **Average Fraud Decision Time**

   - Goal: Reduce decision time by 30% compared to baseline.

2. **SLA Compliance Rate**  
   - Definition: Percentage of suspicious transactions reviewed within defined SLA thresholds.  
   - Goal: ≥ 90% of transactions reviewed within SLA.

3. **Analyst Productivity**  
   - Definition: Number of transactions reviewed per analyst per day.  
   - Goal: Increase productivity by 20%.

4. **False Positive Rate**  
   - Definition: Percentage of blocked transactions later found to be legitimate.  
   - Goal: Reduce unnecessary customer friction.

5. **Escalation Rate**  
   - Definition: Percentage of transactions escalated to senior analysts.  
   - Goal: Maintain low escalation without compromising fraud detection quality.
