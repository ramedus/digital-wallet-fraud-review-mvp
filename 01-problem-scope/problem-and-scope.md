# 1. Problem Statement & Scope

## Background
Digital wallets face increasing fraud risk as transaction volume grows. 
Manual fraud review processes often struggle to keep up with increasing volume and complexity.

## Current Problems
- Fraud review processes are fragmented across email, spreadsheets, and ticketing tools
- No clear SLA tracking for suspicious transactions
- High false positive rates cause unnecessary customer friction
- Limited visibility into analyst performance and decision quality

## Problem Statement
Suspicious transactions in digital wallets need to be reviewed in a centralized, transparent, and measurable way to balance fraud prevention and customer experience.

## MVP Goals
- Reduce average fraud decision time by 30%
- Standardize manual fraud review workflows
- Improve operational efficiency for fraud teams
- Enable meaningful fraud performance reporting

## In Scope
- Suspicious transaction queue
- Transaction detail view
- Manual fraud decisions (Approve / Block / Escalate)
- SLA tracking and basic reporting

## Out of Scope
- Machine learning-based fraud scoring
- Automated refunds and chargebacks
- Customer notifications
- Third-party fraud service integrations
